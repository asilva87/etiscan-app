## Ionic+Angular app made for Etiscan
I wrote this app, firstly, to learn about the required technology stack for the position below:
[Frontend Entwickler â€“ App Programmierung / ERP / Intralogistik (m/w/d)](https://www.etiscan.de/en/jobs/frontend-entwickler-app-programmierung-erp-intralogistik-m-d-w/)

## Run
- Firstly, you need to app Android Studio installed, as well as a runnable Android emulator.
- `npm install`
- `npx cap sync android`
- `npx cap open android`

### Notes
After watching the videos at the [Etiscan Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@etiscanidentifikationssyst4328), I've decided to write a simplified version 
of the Kommissionierung module. It uses the following stack
- Angular
- Ionic
- Capacitor

I had previously no knowledge of Ionic and/or Capacitor.

#### Tested on Android Studio Emulator
