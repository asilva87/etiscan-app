## Ionic+Angular app made for Etiscan

I wrote this app, firstly, to learn about the required technology stack for the position below:
[Frontend Entwickler â€“ App Programmierung / ERP / Intralogistik (m/w/d)](https://www.etiscan.de/en/jobs/frontend-entwickler-app-programmierung-erp-intralogistik-m-d-w/)

It's simple and not intended on displaying best practices or standards on programming, styling, etc. Or even how to use Ionic or Sass, etc. It's just an exercise.
I haven't worked with Angular in 2.5 years. But I can remember it. I'm also aware of its new features, like Signals.

Search feature not working yet. (The fact I'm sending the app with this feature missing doesn't mean that would happen in real work life.)

## Run

- Firstly, you need to app Android Studio installed, as well as a runnable Android emulator.
- `npm install`
- `npx cap sync android`
- `npx cap open android`

### Notes

After watching the videos at the [Etiscan Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@etiscanidentifikationssyst4328), I've decided to write a simplified version
of the Kommissionierung module. It uses the following stack

- Angular
- Ionic
- Capacitor

I had previously no knowledge of Ionic and/or Capacitor.

#### Tested on Android Studio Emulator
